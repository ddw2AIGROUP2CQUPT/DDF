This is the supplementary material of our article presented at the IJCV'17
"Feedback and Surround Modulated Boundary Detection".

We have only used the cpp code to evaluate the computational time of our model.
F-measures reported in the manuscript were obtained with out Matlab code.

In order to run the demo of our model you can execute "SEDDemo.m" in the Matlab
folder.

The main file for cpp is "sed.cpp". The cpp code can be compiled through the
provided CMakeLists.txt.
